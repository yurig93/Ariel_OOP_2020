# Ex01
An implementation of a weighted graph. Some graph algorithms are implemented, like finding the shortest path between nodes.

# Data structures in use
The implementation stores the nodes, weights and links in HashMaps for an efficient traversal.
For the searching mechanism it uses the Dijkstra's algorithm with a PriorityQueue (Heap).
Data is NOT pre loaded to the PQ for an efficient memory usage.
It supports saving and loading the graph to and from a file and it supports deep copies of the graph by using a copy constructor.
Most functions are documented at the interface level and are self explanatory. They contain inline comments in the complex parts of them.

An example can be found in the tests :).
