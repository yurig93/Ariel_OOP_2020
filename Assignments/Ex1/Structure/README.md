<h3 align="center">Exercise 1 - Structure Check</h3>

In this repo you can find a code to check your exercise 1 structure.<br>
First of all, you need to make sure your code meets the following requirements: <br>
* You have the following folders/files: 
  * src
  * tests
  * README.md
* Your **src** folder contains the following files: 
  * node_info.java 
  * weighted_graph.java
  * weighted_graph_algorithms.java
  * WGraph_Algo.java
  * WGraph_DS.java
  
  **THIS PICTURE ILLUSTRATES HOW PACKAGE EX1 SHOULD LOOK LIKE:** <br>

Once your code meets the following requirements you can check yourself. <br>
This code supports the following Operation Systems: **Windows & Linux**.

### Windows:
In order to run the test, please make sure you download structure.java from the Windows folder & run the program. <br>
If your code meets the requirments you should have the following output:

### Linux:
In Linux, we have made a bash script which checks your github repo. <br>
In order to run the test, please make sure you have the following arguments:
* Your github repo
* Number of commit

Open terminal and write the following line: <br>
```
bash TEST arg1 arg2
```

* arg1 = Your github repo link. <br>
  For example: https://github.com/MyUser/ex1.git <br>
* arg2 = Commit Number. <br>
  For example: 096563d6bfg4d329687a28ei3ad210f9f8ef4626 <br>

The bash script will create a new folder named: ex1_test, clone your project into the new directory and run the script. <br>
Once the script is done, you will see the output in the terminal. <br>

### Example:
You can find an example for ex1 structure in [here](https://github.com/Justrygh/ex1)
